  Okay, seriously, there were tags made without updates to this file. So
  version 0.1.5.3 is actually newer than 0.1.6. This mistake would have been
  easily avoided if this file was updated right before a new tag was created.

  This version bump is simply to make the largest tag the latest version which
  is what most people would assume.
